    "# Lab 8.5 - Prompting Large Language Models\n",

    "In this lab we will practise prompting with a few Large Language Models (LLMs) using Groq (not to be confused with Grok). Groq is a platform that provides access to their custom-built AI hardware via APIs, allowing users to run open-source models such as Llama.\n",

    "SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A magnitude 4.2 earthquake shook the San Francisco area Friday at 4:42 a.m. PT (7:42 a.m. ET), the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake left about 2,000 customers without power, said David Eisenhower, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Light. Under the USGS classification, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake is considered \"light,\" which it says usually causes minimal damage. \"We had quite a spike in calls, mostly calls of inquiry, none of any injury, none of any damage that was reported,\" said Capt. Al Casciato of the San Francisco police. \"It was fairly mild.\" Watch police describe concerned calls immediately after the quake » . The quake was centered about two miles east-northeast of Oakland, at a depth of 3.6 miles, the USGS said. Oakland is just east of San Francisco, across San Francisco Bay. An Oakland police dispatcher told CNN the quake set off alarms at people's homes. The shaking lasted about 50 seconds, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. According to the USGS, magnitude 4.2 quakes are felt indoors and may break dishes and windows and overturn unstable objects. Pendulum clocks may stop.\n",

       "2. **Chemical structure**: The molecular structure of the reactants, including the types of bonds and functional groups present.\n",
       "3. **Reaction conditions**: The temperature, pressure, and concentration of the reactants.\n",
       "4. **Catalysts**: The presence of catalysts, which can speed up or slow down the reaction.\n",

Mr. Snugglesworth sat atop his playmat, a smug, cotton smile stitched onto his furry face. Bertie wanted to reach him, desperately.\\n\\nHis attempts were...exasperating. He’d flail his knobby legs, kick a wayward foot across the room, and roll with the fury of a tiny hurricane. He could scoot, he could turn, he could even sit up with a wobbly grin and clap his chubby hands, but Mr. Snugglesworth remained frustratingly out of reach.\\n\\nThen, one sunny morning, something shifted. Bertie, inspired by his reflection in the shiny mobile above him, decided to try something new. He saw his chubby arms reach forward, mirroring the jerky motion of the dangling baubles.\\n\\nHe pushed himself up, his fingers digging into the plush carpet. The room tilted, his vision blurring for a moment, but he steadied himself. His legs wobbled, but he held on. He took a tentative step, a leg inching forward, then another. His grin widened, transforming his face into a permanent open-mouthed expression.\\n\\nHe moved like a wobbling tank, propelled by sheer determination. Every inch gained was a victory. He bumped into his toys, fell on his face, rolled onto his back, and giggled uncontrollably.\\n\\nHe was crawling, even if it was more like an ungainly ballet performed by a fuzzy, leggy disaster. But it was crawling, nonetheless.\\n\\nBertie, spurred on by his accomplishment, crawled towards his nemesis: Mr. Snugglesworth. Each inch closer was met with squeals of delight. Finally, his tiny hands reached the bear’s soft fur.\\n\\nHe collapsed on top of Mr. Snugglesworth, burying his face in the bear's cotton cheek. Mr. Snugglesworth, silent in his plush dignity, seemed to wink his sewn-on eye. Bertie had conquered the world, or at least, his playmat – and for a baby, that was enough.\\n\\n\\nHe’d learned that day, the most valuable lesson a baby can learn: even the most daunting mountains can be climbed, one wobbly step at a time.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Once upon a time, in a cozy little home surrounded by lush green plants and warm sunshine, there lived a baby named Luna. Luna was a bundle of energy and curiosity, always eager to explore the world around her. Her bright blue eyes sparkled with excitement as she discovered new sights, sounds, and smells every day.\\n\\nAs Luna grew bigger and stronger, she began to feel the urge to move beyond the confines of her crib. She watched with envy as her big brother, Finn, effortlessly crawled across the floor, his bright smile and twinkling laughter captivating everyone's attention.\\n\\nLuna's determination was contagious, and her parents, Emily and Ryan, couldn't resist her pleading gaze. They patiently encouraged her to practice crawling, placing toys and other enticing objects just out of reach to motivate her.\\n\\nAt first, Luna tried to imitate Finn's movements, but her little body wobbled and shook as she struggled to coordinate her arms and legs. She flailed her tiny hands and kicked her feet, but it was more like a wobbly dance than actual crawling.\\n\\nEmily and Ryan cheered her on, offering reassurance and support whenever Luna faltered. They reminded her that learning to crawl takes time, patience, and practice, and encouraged her to keep trying.\\n\\nOne sunny afternoon, Luna decided to give it another go. She crawled out of her crib and onto the soft, plush carpet, her eyes fixed on a vibrant red ball sitting just a few inches away. With a determined glint in her eye, she began to push herself forward, her hands and feet working in tandem as she inched closer to her goal.\\n\\nAt first, progress was slow, and Luna's face scrunched up in concentration. She slid backwards, her tiny hands scrambling to regain her balance. But she refused to give up. Instead, she picked herself up, dusted herself off, and tried again.\\n\\nSlowly but surely, Luna gained momentum, her confidence growing with each tiny success. She crawled a little farther, then a little more, until finally, she reached the red ball. With a triumphant squeal, Luna grasped the ball in her fist and held it aloft, her face beaming with pride.\\n\\nEmily and Ryan cheered and hugged Luna, tears of joy welling up in their eyes. \"You did it, little one!\" they exclaimed, beaming with pride.\\n\\nFrom that moment on, Luna became a seasoned crawler, zooming across the floor with ease and giggling with joy. She explored every nook and cranny, discovering new wonders and making memories that would last a lifetime.\\n\\nAs she grew and learned, Luna's parents watched with pride, grateful for the little miracle that had brought such joy and love into their lives. And whenever they looked at their little crawler, they knew that they had played a small part in nurturing her curiosity, her determination, and her incredible spirit.\\n\\nYears later, when Luna looked back on her journey, she would remember the day she learned to crawl as a turning point in her life. It was the moment when she discovered the thrill of exploration, the joy of learning, and the confidence that came with trying new things.\\n\\nAnd as she gazed out at the world, her eyes shining bright with wonder, Luna knew that she was ready for whatever lay ahead – a world full of possibilities, laughter, and endless exploration.</td>\n",

Mr. Snugglesworth sat atop his playmat, a smug, cotton smile stitched onto his furry face. Bertie wanted to reach him, desperately.\\n\\nHis attempts were...exasperating. He’d flail his knobby legs, kick a wayward foot across the room, and roll with the fury of a tiny hurricane. He could scoot, he could turn, he could even sit up with a wobbly grin and clap his chubby hands, but Mr. Snugglesworth remained frustratingly out of reach.\\n\\nThen, one sunny morning, something shifted. Bertie, inspired by his reflection in the shiny mobile above him, decided to try something new. He saw his chubby arms reach forward, mirroring the jerky motion of the dangling baubles.\\n\\nHe pushed himself up, his fingers digging into the plush carpet. The room tilted, his vision blurring for a moment, but he steadied himself. His legs wobbled, but he held on. He took a tentative step, a leg inching forward, then another. His grin widened, transforming his face into a permanent open-mouthed expression.\\n\\nHe moved like a wobbling tank, propelled by sheer determination. Every inch gained was a victory. He bumped into his toys, fell on his face, rolled onto his back, and giggled uncontrollably.\\n\\nHe was crawling, even if it was more like an ungainly ballet performed by a fuzzy, leggy disaster. But it was crawling, nonetheless.\\n\\nBertie, spurred on by his accomplishment, crawled towards his nemesis: Mr. Snugglesworth. Each inch closer was met with squeals of delight. Finally, his tiny hands reached the bear’s soft fur.\\n\\nHe collapsed on top of Mr. Snugglesworth, burying his face in the bear's cotton cheek. Mr. Snugglesworth, silent in his plush dignity, seemed to wink his sewn-on eye. Bertie had conquered the world, or at least, his playmat – and for a baby, that was enough.\\n\\n\\nHe’d learned that day, the most valuable lesson a baby can learn: even the most daunting mountains can be climbed, one wobbly step at a time.  \n",

Break down the numbers into smaller parts. In this case, 13 can be broken down into 10 + 3.\\n2. Calculate 22 * 10: 220 (since 20 * 10 = 200 and adding 2 to it gives you 220)\\n3. Now, calculate 22 * 3: 66\\n4. Add the two results: 220 + 66 = 286\\n\\nSo, the answer is 286.\\n\\nAnother method is:\\n\\n1. Multiply 22 by a nearby round number, 20, which gives you 400, and multiply by 2 (as in 22).\\n2. Calculate 22 x 0.1 * 3 = 6.6\\n3. Then add 6.6 to 400 to get your solution which is 400 + 66 =  286  \n",
       "5  Once upon a time, in a cozy little home surrounded by lush green plants and warm sunshine, there lived a baby named Luna. Luna was a bundle of energy and curiosity, always eager to explore the world around her. Her bright blue eyes sparkled with excitement as she discovered new sights, sounds, and smells every day.\\n\\nAs Luna grew bigger and stronger, she began to feel the urge to move beyond the confines of her crib. She watched with envy as her big brother, Finn, effortlessly crawled across the floor, his bright smile and twinkling laughter captivating everyone's attention.\\n\\nLuna's determination was contagious, and her parents, Emily and Ryan, couldn't resist her pleading gaze. They patiently encouraged her to practice crawling, placing toys and other enticing objects just out of reach to motivate her.\\n\\nAt first, Luna tried to imitate Finn's movements, but her little body wobbled and shook as she struggled to coordinate her arms and legs. She flailed her tiny hands and kicked her feet, but it was more like a wobbly dance than actual crawling.\\n\\nEmily and Ryan cheered her on, offering reassurance and support whenever Luna faltered. They reminded her that learning to crawl takes time, patience, and practice, and encouraged her to keep trying.\\n\\nOne sunny afternoon, Luna decided to give it another go. She crawled out of her crib and onto the soft, plush carpet, her eyes fixed on a vibrant red ball sitting just a few inches away. With a determined glint in her eye, she began to push herself forward, her hands and feet working in tandem as she inched closer to her goal.\\n\\nAt first, progress was slow, and Luna's face scrunched up in concentration. She slid backwards, her tiny hands scrambling to regain her balance. But she refused to give up. Instead, she picked herself up, dusted herself off, and tried again.\\n\\nSlowly but surely, Luna gained momentum, her confidence growing with each tiny success. She crawled a little farther, then a little more, until finally, she reached the red ball. With a triumphant squeal, Luna grasped the ball in her fist and held it aloft, her face beaming with pride.\\n\\nEmily and Ryan cheered and hugged Luna, tears of joy welling up in their eyes. \"You did it, little one!\" they exclaimed, beaming with pride.\\n\\nFrom that moment on, Luna became a seasoned crawler, zooming across the floor with ease and giggling with joy. She explored every nook and cranny, discovering new wonders and making memories that would last a lifetime.\\n\\nAs she grew and learned, Luna's parents watched with pride, grateful for the little miracle that had brought such joy and love into their lives. And whenever they looked at their little crawler, they knew that they had played a small part in nurturing her curiosity, her determination, and her incredible spirit.\\n\\nYears later, when Luna looked back on her journey, she would remember the day she learned to crawl as a turning point in her life. It was the moment when she discovered the thrill of exploration, the joy of learning, and the confidence that came with trying new things.\\n\\nAnd as she gazed out at the world, her eyes shining bright with wonder, Luna knew that she was ready for whatever lay ahead – a world full of possibilities, laughter, and endless exploration.
